# My TODO App

This is my React TODO App that renders a title and an unordered list of todo items. The App is being built by using Vite, a frontend build tool and React.

Examples of my TODO List:

<ul>
    <li>review resources</li>
    <li>take notes</li>
    <li>code out app</li>
</ul>


</details>

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
